I’m not a NASA expert—I’m a builder. 🚀
I just wrapped a small data project using open NASA/JPL feeds (CNEOS + SBDB) to track upcoming asteroid flybys. No product or app—just a practical script that:

pulls the next 30 days of close-approach events

converts AU → lunar distances and estimates sizes from H

enriches MOID and flags PHAs

exports a CSV plus a small watchlist

Why this matters for startups
Many problems don’t need a full platform; they need a useful signal quickly. Open data + small Python + focused prompts to an AI assistant can turn an intimidating domain into:

a watchlist (what should we pay attention to?)

a report (what changed this week?)

an alert (tell me when X crosses Y)

What surprised me
A few days ago I didn’t know what albedo, MOID, or PHA meant. With GPT as a coach, I unblocked the concepts, debugged faster, and shipped a working script. It’s not about being a space expert; it’s about reducing time-to-insight.

The mindset
Demis Hassabis has emphasized that the differentiator is the ability to keep learning and adapting. That resonates: pair curiosity with strong tools, and you can move from “this looks hard” to “here’s something actionable” in days, not quarters.

Where this pattern applies (outside space)

Market intelligence: scrape/public APIs → rolling watchlist of competitor moves

Risk signals: regulatory updates → flag items that match your exposure

Ops analytics: support tickets/logs → simple daily anomaly report

RevOps: product usage + CRM → list of accounts likely to expand/churn

What I actually shipped

close_approaches.csv (full dataset)

watchlist.csv (very close or PHA-flagged)

a couple of command-line knobs (--days, --dist)

quick plot for distance vs. time

If you’ve got a dataset and a fuzzy question, I’m happy to turn it into a watchlist or simple decision aid. I’ll drop notes/repo in the comments.
